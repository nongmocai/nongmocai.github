### Project and Problem

Ericsson offers an end-to-end Wi-Fi calling solution for smartphones and multiple devices, Service Entitlement Solution (SES). Part of the development work is designated to the Guangzhou site, where am leading the UX design since August 2015. Working on projects under the SES, I create designs for the web and iPhone.

The current Administration tool for managing Wi-Fi calling is quite out-of-date, calling for a User Experience assessment and improvement suggestion. This is the story of how I performed the User Experience assessment and provided design solutions to the problems discovered.

*To comply with the confidentiality agreements I obfuscated the confidential information in this case stud., but I will talk about my involvement in the process and how I have taken the accumulated knowledge within the process to create a design solution.*


### My Role

As the dedicated User Experience designer for the SES product, I am responsible for the following aspects:

User journey map • navigation map • heuristic evaluation • usability test • sketches • high fidelity mock-ups • assessment report


### Collaboration

I work with a project manager, an Agile Product Owner (APO), a Solution Architect and a team of developers to identify the insights and to transfer the design concepts into implementation.

### Vision and Planning

I evangelized the UX goal to the APO and prioritized the features that will be implemented in the subsequent sprints.

### Leadership

I initiated the involvement of the UX design for this project, which lead to the redesign for the Administration tool, and also some NDA projects.

### User Journey Map

For this project, I conducted a user journey map workshop with the stakeholders to understand who our personas were and how they are using the current product, especially about the administration tool. Due to the company policy, the workshop is only conducted among internal employees.

The User Journey Map involved stages such as:

* Pre – Usage (from selling to development)
* Usage (how the customer uses the tools)
* Post – Usage (from software upgrade to bug fixing)

The personas included:

*	Pre-sales
*	Product manager (Customer)
*	Solution Architect
*	Service Integrator
*	System Administrator (Customer)
*	1st level customer-care Engineer
* 2nd level customer-care Engineer
*	Design Maintenance Engineer

### UX Assessment

1. **Personas**

    We have conducted user interviews from different sites of our company globally, and created a wide range of persona which is stored in the persona library after the interviews.  I adopted the existing personas for this project.  Through the process, I get to understand the persona’s needs and pinpoints, which will validate my future design.

2. **Key Tasks**

    In a discussion with the Agile Product Owner (APO), we defined the key tasks on the administration tool, as well as when and how the relevant personas perform such tasks.

    </div>

3. **Navigation Map**

    Creating the navigation map helped me form a broader view of the system and how the target users performed the tasks one by one; it also ensured a more cohesive design. As I linked it to the user’s pain points this map inspired me on the potential design opportunities.

4. **Heuristic Evaluation**

    I examined the interface and judged it's compliance with the usability principles.

    Key issues found:

    * The overall status was not shown on the home page
    * The Key Performance Indicators were too old to enable effective decisions
    * Navigation model was complicated
    * Confusing workflow and no system feedback after completion
    * Branding not aligned with the company’s guideline.


5. **Usability Testing**

    I recruited the Developers from other team and projects to complete the key tasks in a 30 minutes usability testing session. Observing how the users used the tool was an effective way of confirming the existing findings and also helped me to discover new problems that I had not instantly been aware of.

6. **Sketches and High Fidelity Mock-ups**

    Before going into designing with the computer, I opted to sketch my design and thoughts on paper. This helped me to quickly brainstorm for different solutions instead of just focusing on one idea.

7. **UX Assessment and Improvements Report**

    A report containing the personas, the usability test result, UX improvements and mock-ups were sent to the management team at HQ, Sweden. The rest of the design for this project will be implemented in the middle of 2016
