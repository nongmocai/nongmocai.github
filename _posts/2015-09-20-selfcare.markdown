### Project and Problem

In 2014 – 2015, the company worked towards the delivering of a self-care service for Operator customers. This is the process of how I created the user experience design for the self-care service.

The major objective was creating a web self-care that empowers Operator’s subscribers to access and control their services anywhere, anytime.

*To comply with the confidentiality agreements I will not show the final work I did for the customer, but I I have taken the accumulated knowledge within the process to create a reinterpretation of the self-care service.*


### My Role

The requirements for the mobile web self-care service were divided between the chief UX designer and me. For my tasks, I conducted the following work:

• Competitive analysis •  sketches •  design mock-ups •  demo video

### Collaboration

I worked closely with Agile product owner, the chief UX designer and teams of remote/in-house developers to ensure the design and interaction was implemented with good User Experience.

Meetings with key stakeholders helped us to better gain an alignment on the features that we’re developing. During the meetings we would present the discoveries in the competitive analysis and propose new functionality toward the self-care service that we are building.

We worked in an Agile environment where certain features would be delivered within each sprint , which was every three weeks. Within this process we emphasized rapid sketching, wire-framing and design mock-ups. This had created early team-wide alignment, sparked tons of ideas, and solved problems efficiently when there were problems with the development.

### Persona

The company had a wide set of clients that’s been created based on global wide user-interviews and stored within the client database; to try and understand the users I am designing for, I adopted the existing personas for this project, as well as some extra online research on operator’s forums to gain additional information about the users.

### Competitive analysis

As a starting point we did an intense research on different operator’s self-care applications, and then collected the screenshots and analyzed the features that they have. The key point was to not only find out what the important features were but also come up with ideas on what additional features would be good from the aspect of User Experience. That’s also when the previous research on the Operator’s site came into play.

### Designing

Unfortunately not all the design proposed in the early stage was implemented because it was considered nice to have and was consequently de-prioritized compared with the backend development tasks, and could not be squeezed into the schedule of the current delivery.

Early sketches exploring the design for different use cases.

Before the final delivery, I also created a demo video that guided the integration engineers through the process of the design.

The following design principles were used in the designing process.

In the original design there was a sidebar menu. But the popular hamburger menu actually hides the information, and every time the user wants to go to a different page he has to open the side menu first. Thus in the later version I removed the hamburger menu, and placed tabs on the bottom for a quick access; the advanced/ secondary features were placed within the “Others” tab. Having the tabs on the bottom would also be easier to click on no matter how big the screen size was.


**Giving forecasts on usage/bill**

We wanted to prompt users to top up their accounts immediately when their usage is low or a bill is due soon, to **avoid the sudden withdraw of services and late fees**. Being informed of this, the user **gains a sense of control** while using the app.

**Indication of consumption**

For the overview picture, we wanted the user to get an idea of the spend at a glance. So I used the balls to indicate how much usage is left.

In the usage page, there is additional information on the daily usage. This would help the user to decide what is the average consumption per day, and whether it is necessary to switch to a more appropriate plan.

Since this self-care service supports one-click buy, I wanted to make sure the user wouldn’t accidently press the "buy" button or have something in their bag to press on it. The swipe to pay button is designed to prevent these type of problems.
