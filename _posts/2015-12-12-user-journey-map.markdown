### Project and Problem

Ericsson offers an end-to-end Wi-Fi calling solution for smartphones and multiple devices. Part of the development work was designated to the Guangzhou site, where I lead the UX design since August 2015. Working on projects under the SES, I created designs for the web and iPhone.

The current Administration tool for managing Wi-Fi calling was  very old, it needed a User Experience assessment and improvement suggestion. This is the story of how I performed the User Experience assessment and provided design solutions to the problem discovered.

### My Role

This project took place between – 2015 to – 2015. As the dedicated User Experience designer for the SES product, I was responsible for the following:

User journey map, navigation map, heuristic evaluation, usability test, sketches, high fidelity mock-ups, user experience assessment report.

### Collaboration

I worked with a project manager, an Agile Product Owner (APO), a Solution Architect and a team of developers to identify the insights and to transfer the design concepts into implementation.

### Vision and Planning

I evangelized the UX goal to the APO and prioritized the features that will be implemented in the following sprints.

### Leadership

I initiated the involvement of the UX design for this project, which lead to the redesign for the Administration tool, and also some NDA projects.

### User Journey Map

For this project, I conducted a user journey map workshop with the stakeholders to understand who our personas were and how they are using the current product, especially about the administration tool. Due to the company policy, the workshop was only conducted with internal employees.

The User Journey Map involved stages such as:

* Pre – Usage (from selling to development)
* Usage (how the customer uses the tools)
* Post – Usage (from software upgrade to bug fixing)

The personas included:

*	Pre-sales
*	Product manager (Customer)
*	Solution Architect
*	Service Integrator
*	System Administrator (Customer)
*	1st level customer-care Engineer
* 2nd level customer-care Engineer
*	Design Maintenance Engineer

### UX Assessment

1. **Personas**

    The company had a set of persona that’s been created based on global wide user-interviews and stored within the persona library, the personas for this project were part of the persona collection. To try and understand the users I am designing for, I adopted the existing personas for this project.

2. **Key Tasks**

    In a discussion with the Agile Product Owner (APO), we defined the key tasks on the administration tool, as well as when and how the relevant personas perform such tasks.

3. **Navigation Map**

    Creating the navigation map helped me form a broader view of the system and how the target users performed the tasks one by one; it also ensured a more cohesive design. As it was linked to the pain points this map inspired me on the potential design opportunities.

4. **Heuristic Evaluation**

    I examined the interface and judged it's compliance with the usability principles.

    Key issues found:

    * The monitoring dashboard was hidden
    * The health Key Performance Indicators were too old to enable effective decisions
    * Navigation model was complicated
    * Confusing workflow and no system feedback after completion
    * Branding not aligned with the company’s guideline.

5. **Usability Testing**

    Developers from other team and projects were recruited to complete the key tasks in the 30 minutes usability testing. Observing how the users used the tool was an effective way of confirming the existing findings and discovering new problems that I had not instantly been aware of.

6. **UX improvements and Suggestions**

    Provided design and suggestions on the following aspects:

7. **Sketches and High Fidelity Mock-ups**

    Before going into designing with the computer, I opted to sketch my design and thoughts on the paper. This helped me to quickly brainstorm for different solutions instead of just focusing on one idea.

8. **UX Assessment and Improvements Report**

    A report containing the personas, the usability test result, UX improvements and mock-ups were sent to the management team at HQ, Sweden. The redesign for this project will be implemented in the middle of 2016.
